This vegan yogi expands conscious thought about body awareness, mental health, and healing with sound currents. She uses kundalini yoga as a way to exercise the mind, body, and spirit&mdash;a technique which enables one to reach a higher state of awareness, emotional stability, and strength by using several techniques, including pranayama, kriyas, meditation, bhandas, mudras, mantras, and visualization.

Meditation and gong relaxation with Gurumantra Kaur is presented in conjunction with the ELEMENTALS Birds exhibition on display through December 10, 2011, with Inga and Andy Hamilton, artists from Northern Ireland, in residence through Thursday, November 10. ELEMENTALS Birds is an experiment to see if artists, printmakers, and craftspeople can physically embody feelings of peace, harmony, and goodwill in their artwork and tangibly affect the space around them.

Free and open to the public. Bring a cushion or mat if you have one. Please share this information with students and friends!
