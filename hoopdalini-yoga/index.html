<h2>That's right, Hula Hoop Yoga!<&#47;h2><br />
Hoopdalini Yoga is a intermingling of Kundalini Yoga with Hula Hooping. We warm up our limbs, and stretch our muscles with the grace and balance of hooping. Focusing on our 3rd chakra, balancing the lower triangle and allowing our kundalini and awareness to flow up and around us with the movement. While consciously opening our heart center, and strengthening our aura. This is a fun and energetic way to build strength and flexibility.</p>
