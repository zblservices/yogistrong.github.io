								<h2>How I got on my Yogi Path.... </h2>
<p>Yoga for me started back in 2004. I found yoga after getting ill from depression, allergies and being In a unpleasant marriage. Once I started Yoga, I found Kundalini Yoga to be the one type of Yoga to really make me feel good about myself and my life.</p>
<p>When I first started doing doing Kundalini Yoga (KY) I was no able to do very much. It was then that I knew I wanted to complete a whole set without stopping. Once I was able to finish the set (Kriya) the next step was to hold the posture, better my breathing or increase the speed, etc... It took a whole for me to really get to the stage where I felt this is me and my life will surround Yoga all the time.</p>
<p>It must have been in 2006 that I started changing my life. I had gotten a divorce 2 years prior and went through a big change finding myself... this was not the most pleasant or proudest moments of my life. Soon, after doing KY when I could and improving myself and life with the awareness I was gaining, I knew that I wanted to attend a school for KY to improve my spiritual self, actually improve all of me. I was having a hard time finding the right school.. or one that offered KY. I was doing research but wasn&rsquo;t happy with the results. I now know that It wasn&rsquo;t the right time for me back then. I stuck with It though, pushing through to find that one school and still trying my best to Keep up.</p>
<p>After a couple of years I thought there was no way it was going to happen for me. Money, location, transportation and such were not going my way. I was done, crying and upset with the loss of my dream that was giving me so much hope to live and create the life and world I wanted to live in. With this feeling of failure..</p>
<p>I became mad and felt I shouldn&rsquo;t give up... not yet. I was going to go for it one more time, there had to be SOMETHING, SOMEONE, ANYONE, ANYTHING, who could guide, help or show me what I needed. So I searched a bit more. Doing the same searches as before.. and then there it was. My chance of growing, mastering and guiding. So I signed up to a Yoga Center in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Starting in the summer of 2009, when I signed up, I stopped drinking. In August, I stopped eating meat.</p>
<p>Since September 2009, I have been doing more KY then ever. Reading and leaming, experiencing and sharing love, happiness, health and ME.</p>
<p>They say that once you are &ldquo;Committed&rdquo; (one of the first steps to happiness and mastery), you start to change your lifestyle, eating habits, clothing, and friends. I have changed all of them since I committed myself to KY. I have never felt so overcome with love and support from every life force that is close to me. I have grown so much, I am not the same person yet I am me. I am, I am.</p>
<p>I am on the path to awareness and enlightenment. I am going to help others in this world realize that they too can have this feeling. Everything is simple. We are simple. BUT we complicate things. So in order to clear the path I will show how to release the tension and fog In our lives by using Kundalini Yoga.</p>
