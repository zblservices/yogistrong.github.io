						<h2>Summer Solstice</h2>
						<p>Posted 29 Jun 2010</p>
					</header>
					<div class="container story">
								Sat Nam, On June 15th, also my birthday, I flew out to New Mexico. I was heading to Summer Solstice at Guru Ram Das Puri. This day was extremely difficult for me. I started traveling at 3am to Syracuse, from there I flew to Chicago and then to NM. It was another 2 hours of driving before we reached the site. My Solstice experience started on the shuttle ride. Meeting new and fun people. Some I knew of and some I just met. Once I was on the site, the elevation (7,000 ft) really hit me, plus the all the traveling and anxiety was adding up. I couldn&rsquo;t eat dinner and was very lonely. That night, there was a lighting storm, miles away, that lit the whole sky. Oh did I mention the coyotes? Yes they were loud and roaming about.

The following couple of days were fairly easy. We (Kids Food Service Scholarship) worked hard on organizing and planning for the coming week. I was waking up at 3am for sadhana and then working as much as needed (normally 5 to 6 hours a day). Afterwards I was normally free to attend workshops, the bazaar, and napping. The heat was strong, but since it was a dry heat it was not over powering. I really liked the dry heat, you never really sweat. =)

The three days of White Tantric were amazing. I feel so clear and happy. It really lifts the weight of your body and mind. Aligning your strengths and energy with your life plan.

Summer Solstice seems to bring something different up in everyone each time we attend. It is a way to be cleansed, let go of fears, blocks and negativity. Everyone who attends rejoices in the sounds, music, love, energy, food, and friendships they gain. It is a must to attend Summer Solstice. You leave augmented.

Wahe-Guru.
