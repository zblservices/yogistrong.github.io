Sat Nam,

It has been way to long since I last updated my blog. A lot has been going on... I have moved into a new home that my Partner has bought for us. I have taught over 120 Kundalini Yoga classes in Potsdam, NY. I have started one out of five modules in the Level two KYTT, Conscious Communication. I&rsquo;m getting a new tattoo this Tuesday. I am happy, healthy (knock on wood), holy, and becoming stronger mentally, physically, and emotionally everyday. <!--more-->I have great jobs, with good income, a nice home with awesome animals and a loving boyfriend. An amazing Kundalini Yoga Community (even if they don&rsquo;t live in my direct community). I am chanting everyday. Slowly building up my sadhana and reading when I can.

In this level two KYTT, Conscious Communication, I have to write or discuss Chapter One and how it has effected me and how I relate to them as a spiritual being and a teacher. Here is my discussion/write up. ....

Some words from Chapter One that have a big impact on Conscious Communication; Vitality, Character, Sunni-ia, Consciousness, Virtue, Communication, Non-Duality, Simplicity, Forgiving, Compassionate, Awareness, Listener, Observer, Clear, Precise, and sadhana. All these words, like all words, have a huge impact on you and those around you. Yogi Ji said, &ldquo;The power of the person is in the word&rdquo;, and the word has power.

This Chapter has helped me to realize that I am not always alert when in conversation with someone. I have slowly started to notice, since I started this module, that I&rsquo;ve become more aware of the environment we are in, their and my own body language. The tone of our voices. Am I listening to what they are really saying? .. and Do they really understand what I am stating? These are just some of the thoughts that cross my mind lately in Conscious Communication.

I am working on being a strong role model, one with character, strength, forgiveness and compassion. I want to share the energy and love with all around me, so they can unlock that vitality and virtue in their core self... becoming a bright light in this world. Slowly this will happen through the Conscious Communication.

Saying what you mean, straight, simple and with a smile. This allows others, especially my students, to understand what I saying.. no hidden agendas. Speaking from the navel really has a strong impact on how your word is being processed. They really hear me, allowing the vibrations of the word to be absorbed into the thought process.

One thing that I have learned, one thing that needed to be corrected... I can speak slow, conscious, and pause when needed. Allowing the thoughts to integrate. Before I was always &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; so fast that some times people where confused on what I was talking about. I would sometimes jump around in thoughts while trying to communicate. I would even cut people off in mid sentence to finish what they were saying.. just because I was not being aware, conscious or even respectful. Now that I have seen this, I am now able to correct it. It is a hard thing to beak a habit, but with sadhana, and a mindfulness &ldquo;bell&rdquo; or break I am able to collect my self, thoughts, and energy. Thus using all my strength and awareness to communicate, and listen with my full self.

I have a study group tomorrow to discuss three chapters. I really cannot wait to hear what the other Shakti Pumpkins have to say. For now I must go read. Be well and thanks for your time in reading my blog. =)
