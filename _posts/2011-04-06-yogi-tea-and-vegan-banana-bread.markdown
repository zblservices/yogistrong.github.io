#Yogi Tea
This tea is known to be good for the blood and colon, the nervous system and bones, as well for any colds, flus or physical weakness.

* 13 sticks of cinnamon
* 2 large handfuls ginger (skinned and chopped in lengths)
* 3 tbsp cardamom seeds (crushed, use a knife or rolling pin) <!--more-->
* 1 tbsp cloves
* 1 1/3 tbsp black pepper
* 2 gallons of water

Bring water to a boil, add ingredients. Simmer on low/medium for about 2 hours. Let cool slightly, then strain. Add almond milk, and agave syrup to sweeten. (This recipe normally is sweetened with honey, use if you prefer)

Thanks to Dev Suroop Kaur for this amazing recipe. =)
