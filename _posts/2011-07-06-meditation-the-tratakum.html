<p>During Summer Solstice, at Ram Das Puri, in New Mexico, Yogi Amandeep Singh taught &ldquo;Awakening The Warrior Within: Teachings Of Rajyog Guru Gobind Singh&rdquo;. During this session he asked us to turn our attention to the sky or to one of the mountains in the distance. We were to do a tratakum meditation, it&rsquo;s a form of meditational gazing. This was my first time doing this technique and I figured the mountain would be easier on the eyes. What I learned about myself and the mountain was transforming. Gazing at a NM mountain I learned the following about it and myself (and how I want to be in this incarnation):</p>
<p>[quote]We our courageous, bountiful, beautiful, awe-inspiring, nurturing, stands our ground, lets the flow of life travel around and within us, people want to be near us, we&rsquo;re grounded, we reach many heights, we have many different types of terrain, we make people happy, we&rsquo;re strong and supportive to all, we elevate physically and spiritually, we&rsquo;re connected with the land around us, and we are multi faceted.[/quote]</p>
<p>I suggest everyone try a daily meditation. Meditating helps with racing minds, stress, anxiety, fears, and allows your subconscious to release negative thoughts. The results allow you to be quite, centered, and relaxed. You gain awareness, and peace. There are many different types of meditations for all sorts of issues... but just taking time to consciously breath is a great start. You may not be relaxed while doing your meditation and you may be thinking about everything you don&rsquo;t want to think about during this process too. Just know this is a normal way for the body, mind, and spirit to release the fears and blocks. The results will happen after. It is a process and needs attention like everything thing else. So keep up!</p>
<p>I also recommend keeping a journal for your meditations. Write down any thoughts, issues, releases, and feelings that happen throughout the day, the week, and into the month. We take vitamins and medicines for all sorts of aliments. Meditation is just like those supplements, it keeps your mind healthy and happy. Taking care of your body isn&rsquo;t just popping pills and stretching.. there are many facets to being healthy, and having a daily meditation is one of those facets.</p>
