Ingredients:

* 2 large portabellas
* 1 medium tomato
* 1 cup of brown rice
* handful of asparagus
* 1 can of kidney beans
* handful of pea sprouts
* 3 tbsp Bragg <!--more-->
* 3 tbsp dry red wine
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tsp lemon juice
* 1 tsp vegan butter
* pinch red pepper flakes
* 1/2 tsp basil
* 1/2 tsp parsley
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper

Rice and Beans: Add 2 cups of water, brown rice, basil, parsley, oregano, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, and 1 tbsp of olive oil to a medium pot. Bring to a boil. Once boiling cover and then simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 18 minutes. When water is almost evaporated, add the kidney beans and 1 tbsp of dry red wine.

Portabellas: Clean mushrooms. In a medium to large pan, on medium heat, add 2 tbsp olive oil, and 3 tbsp bragg. When the oil in warm, add whole mushrooms to pan. Cover and simmer, turning the mushrooms over after about 4 minutes. Once you flip the mushrooms, add 2 tbsp of dry red wine. Cook until tender.

Asparagus: Wash asparagus, and trim about 1 inch off the bottom. In a medium sauce pan, melt 1 tsp of vegan butter (I use earth balance). Add asparagus, fresh ground pepper, and lemon juice. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring as needed.

When plating, add pea shoots and diced tomato to garnish.

Feeds 2 to 3 adults.
