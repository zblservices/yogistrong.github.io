<p>I have a lot going on lately, but there is one thing keeping me disciplined. I do a 31 minute Meditation every day. I know without my sadhana I would be a little more lost. I can always come to my sadhana for quite, and some peace, and to wash my brain from the days stresses. Most Yogis do their sadhana in the morning. I do mine at night. This is the time that works best for me at this moment in my life.</p>
<p>I suggest that everyone take some time in their day to be with themselves. It can be for 3 minutes, 5, 7, 11, or 31 minutes, to 2 1/2 hours a day to meditate, to breath, to let yourself listen to your heart beat. Feel the rhythm of your own life force. Notice your aura, your muscles, the way your skin feels, how your mind and body are reacting to being quite, and still.</p>
<p>Your body heals when you are at rest. When I am meditating I may seem at rest, peaceful, and still, but most of the time my brain is thinking about tons of things. It is working out the blocks, the hidden agendas, and any other neurosis going on within me. At some point though, I become still. I reach that Shunni-ya. I become zero, I think of nothing, but I am here. It may last for 2 seconds, to 1 minute.. but I know that I have done something amazing. I have reach my inner self, my divine self.</p>
<p>Be strong, have faith, and trust your self. Some people see weakness in being so disciplined. I see strength and courage. It is not easy to sit with your self, to look at ones self, to know and to listen to what you have done with your life, and where you are going. Maybe your life has been good or bad.. but everything can change for the better when you stop and take time for you. To change the pattern of thoughts, so you can be happy.</p>
<p>Sat Naam.</p>
