<p>This cookies recipe is from the Post Punk Kitchen. They have all sorts of vegan recipes... and have several awesome cookbooks to purchase. My favorite one is <a title="http://astore.amazon.com/yogstr-20/detail/1569243581" href="http://astore.amazon.com/yogstr-20/detail/1569243581">Vegan with a Vengeance </a>. The ice creamy part of this dessert was taken from several other peoples ideas on vegan ice cream. I hope you enjoy this delicious summer treat!</p>
<h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2><br />
Makes two dozen two inch cookies or about 16 three inch cookies</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 brown sugar</li>
<li>1/4 white sugar</li>
<li>2/3 cup canola oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or your favorite non-dairy milk)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tapioca flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>3/4 cups chocolate chips</li><br />
</ul><br />
Preheat oven to 350 F. Lightly grease two large light metal baking sheets.</p>
<p>Mix together sugars, oil, milk and tapioca flour in a mixing bowl. Use a strong fork and mix really well, for about 2 minutes, until it resembles smooth caramel. There is a chemical reaction when sugar and oil collide, so it&rsquo;s important that you don&rsquo;t get lazy about that step. Mix in the vanilla.</p>
<p>Add 1 cup of the flour, the baking soda and salt. Mix until well incorporated. Mix in the rest of the flour. Fold in the chocolate chips. The dough will be a little stuff so use your hands to really work them in.</p>
<p>For 3 inch cookies, roll the dough into about ping pong ball size balls. Flatten them out in your hands to about 2 1/2 inches. They will spread just a bit. Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 8 minutes &ndash; no more than 9 &ndash; until they are just a little browned around the edges. I usually get 16 out of these so I do two rounds of eight cookies. Let cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.</p>
<h2>Banana Filling</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>2 bananas</li>
<li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
<li>3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter</li><br />
</ul><br />
Take 2 peeled bananas and slice them. Put them in the freezer for at least 2 hours. Once the bananas are frozen add them to a blender with the maple syrup and peanut butter. Blend until creamy.</p>
<p>After the cookies have cooled, take the banana filling and add as much or as little as you want on to the cookie and make a sandwich. Freeze the cookie sandwiches and enjoy when ready. =)</p>
