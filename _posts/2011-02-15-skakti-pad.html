<p>There is a stage in a Yogi&rsquo;s life when they are confronted with their beliefs (at that time), with their thoughts on self (ego), and many other obstacles that would cause them to reconsider their life choice as a Yogi. This stage is called Shakti Pad. It is the third stage out of five stages.... 5 being the master, being zero (Shuniya) yet infinitely everything. I have reached this stage, Shakti Pad, and it is surprising how much I am thinking. They say that to get past this stage you need to take a leap of faith. If you do not leap forward, then you will never pass this stage. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I couldn&rsquo;t fall back once I have passed this stage. .. but I find this stage tiring and emotional.</p>
<p>So how do I leap forward? Well, this is interesting because when I come across something that bothers me.... (e.g. I work at a bar and everyone drinks.. and being a Yogi I don&rsquo;t consume alcohol. Lately I have been thinking a lot about drinking. My friends seem happy and why not 1 glass of wine) ..... I have to really think about the consequences of that/those actions. My thoughts are about how I am living my life, where I want to be, the Karma I am burning off, and how I am effecting others, as well as how I am effecting my body, mind, and spirit.</p>
<p>I truly enjoy teaching Yoga. Everyday I find myself in their shoes. How do I feel mentally? Physically? Emotionally? Am I projecting my true self? (Sat Nam) Do I have any inner anger? There are so many things to think about.. where you want to be, who you want to be. I am where I want to be.. and I am who I want to be. Keeping where I am and who I am is harder then anything else. I want to improve as a spiritual being, as a Yogi, as a partner, as a human. ... but.... every now and then there comes that evil or opposite way of thinking.. and you say why not?? Why not try a glass a wine today? Why not sleep in instead of getting up for sadhana? Why not?? So I have to remember where I want to be and who I am and aim to be.. and will those choices put me there? I know right from wrong.. and when you are a Yogi.. there is not a right and wrong.. there is Karma, Dharma, and Liberation.</p>
<p>What really helps getting through this time... would be a strong 3HO community. This community is the Healthy, Happy, Holy (as in wholeness) Community. Kundalini Yoga is part of this community of amazing people that share their love, compassions, interest, yoga, spiritualness, and everything else that makes us say I am, I am. We are one, Namaste. So, If I had a strong 3HO community here it would be easier for me. Since where I live is so small and just getting into the Yoga energy there is no one to lean on. There is me. I am trying to be the lighthouse. I am holding up the teachings. I am doing my own practice. I am also still working as a bartender, over all I am being a householder. Doing this by your self, well it gets lonely. So I ask me self.. Why not??</p>
<p>This leap of faith, I will take it. I know I will. It will take time to get there. .. but I am determined to pass this stage with strength and grace. Venting about it really helps =) I cannot turn off the Yogi, but I am trying not to dim the Yogi-ness within me. So anyone who sees me out and about in Potsdam, NY... throw a smile my way. I will share with you that strong sense of community. Lets help each other deal with our selves. Lets not dim our selfs. Lets stay strong, be the light, be yourself, and be pure.</p>
<p>That leap of faith... I can see the rope and grabbing on to it.. I will hold it and let it guide me through this stage... this Shakti Pad.</p>
<p>Wahe Guru Ji Ka Khalsa</p>
<p>Wahe Guru Ji Ki Fateh</p>
