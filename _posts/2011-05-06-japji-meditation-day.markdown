I have attended and lead group sadhana in the past, and during this time recited Japji, but I have not recited Japji everyday. Now after only 4 days into SpiritVoyage&rsquo;s 40 day Japji sadhana I have found the effects to be numerous.

The hour after I&rsquo;ve done the Japji meditation, I find my mind starts repeating different parts of this sacred text. A different Pauree will keep repeating in my head and sometimes through out the day. I feel calm and relaxed afterwards. Even though I am calm my brain is working overtime. Thinking about very creative and visionary topics for my personal plans, and how to reach others through the teachings of Kundalini Yoga. I even thought of a workshop to teach while sleeping last night.

I have found the last few nights dreams to be intensive. I am working out my fears and anxieties. It can be stressful, but I am lucid dreaming and therefore know why and what is happening. Then I am able to wake up and remember these important messages from me to me.

I have to say that this meditation has a fast and effective way of hitting the mind and soul. I cannot wait to see what else comes up. Japji is helping me in ways I never thought it could do. Wahe-Guru!
