<div>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 large bunches of Kale</li>
<li>1 large Onion</li>
<li>4 Garlic Cloves</li>
<li>2 Leeks</li>
<li>2 cups Baby Portabella Mushrooms</li>
<li>2 medium Carrots</li>
<li>2 Celery Stems</li>
<li>2 tbsp Bragg</li>
<li>1/2 cup Dry Red Wine</li>
<li>1 qt of Vegetable Broth</li>
<li>2 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
<li>3 Bay leaves</li>
<li>tsp of salt</li>
<li>tbsp pepper</li>
<li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
<li>tbsp of parsley</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp of basil</li>
<li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li><br />
</ul><br />
Clean kale twice, to ensure all the dirt is off. Cut or tear leafy green kale from their stem. (The stem is chewing and hard to digest.) Clean and chop onions, garlic, celery, carrots, and mushrooms. In a large sauce pan saute the onions, and garlic, until the onions are semi clear, about 3 minutes. Add celery, carrots, mushrooms, and bragg. After about 2 minutes add the red wine, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, parsley, and basil. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 to 8 cups of water to a boil. Slowly add the kale to the boiling water, adding more kale as it starts softening, until all the kale is added. Once all the kale is cooking, add the ingredients from the large sauce pan, and the vegetable broth into the pot. Bring the soup to a slow simmer, cover soup and continue cooking for about 30 minutes. Before serving add apple cider vinegar to soup.</p>
